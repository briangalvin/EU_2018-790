# COMMISSION RECOMMENDATION (EU) 2018/790 of 25 April 2018 on access to and preservation of scientific information  

This policy covers the following interrelated aspects of Open Science (including access to and preservation of scientific information):
  - the dissemination of and open access to scientific publications resulting from publicly funded research;
  - the management of research data resulting from publicly funded research, including open access;
  - reinforcing the preservation and re-use of scientific information (publications, data sets and other research outputs);
  - developing infrastructures underpinning the system for access to, preservation, sharing and re-use of scientific information and for promoting their federation within the EOSC;
  - the necessary skills and competences of researchers and personnel of academic institutions regarding scientific information;
  - for adjusting, with regards to scientific information, the recruitment and career evaluation system for researchers, the evaluation system for awarding research grants to researchers, and the evaluation systems for research performing institutions; 
  
This implemenation of this policy will be detailed in successive national action plans, and provides for:
  - concrete objectives and indicators to measure progress,
  - implementation plans, including the allocation of responsibilities and appropriate licensing,
  - associated financial planning.  

## Open access to scientific publications

1. Member States should ensure, in compliance with the EU acquis on copyright and related rights, that as a result of these policies or action plans:  

    - all scientific publications resulting from publicly-funded research are made available in open access as from 2020 at the latest,
    - whatever the channel of publication (scientific journal, digital infrastructure, multimedia channels, or any new and experimental methods of scholarly communication), open access to publications resulting from publicly funded research be granted as soon as possible, preferably at the time of publication, and in any case no later than six months after the date of publication (no later than 12 months for social sciences and humanities),
    - taking into account technological developments, licensing terms used on the market do not unduly restrict text and data mining of publications resulting from publicly funded research, in accordance with and without prejudice to applicable copyright legislation,
    - researchers, when entering into contractual agreements with scientific publishers, retain the necessary intellectual property rights, inter alia, to comply with the open access policy requirements. This concerns in particular self-archiving and re-use (notably through text and data mining),
    - information is published about agreements between public institutions or groups of public institutions and publishers on the supply of scientific information, in order to enhance market transparency and fair competition, without prejudice to the protection of know-how and business information (trade secrets). This should include all sorts of agreements covering in particular the so-called ‘big deals’ (i.e. bundles of print and electronic journal subscriptions offered at discounted prices) and the related ‘offsetting deals’ aimed at obtaining discounted open access publishing fees for consortia,
    - innovative companies, in particular small and medium-sized enterprises, independent researchers (for instance citizen scientists), the public sector, the press and citizens at large have, in a transparent and non-discriminatory manner, the widest possible access to scientific publications of the results of research that receives public funding in view of enabling innovation, empowering the public sector and informing citizens.

2. Member States should ensure that research funding institutions responsible for managing public research funding and academic institutions receiving public funding implement the policies and national action plans referred to in point 1 at national level in a coordinated way by:
    - Setting institutional policies for the dissemination of and open access to scientific publications, and establishing implementation plans,
    - including requirements for open access as a condition to give out grant agreements or to provide other financial support for research, together with mechanisms for monitoring compliance with these requirements and follow up actions to correct cases of non-compliance,
    - making the necessary funding available for dissemination (including open access and re-use) in a transparent and non-discriminatory manner allowing for different channels, including digital infrastructures where appropriate, as well as new and experimental methods of scholarly communication,
    - providing guidance to researchers on how to comply with open access policies, and supporting them to do so, especially regarding the management of their intellectual property rights to ensure open access to their publications,
    - conducting joint negotiations with publishers to obtain transparent and the best possible terms for access to publications, including use and re-use,
    - ensuring that publications resulting from public funding are easily identifiable by appropriate technical means, including through metadata attached to electronic versions of the research output and persistent identifiers.

## Management of research data, including open access

3. Member States should ensure that, as a result of these policies or action plans:
    - Data management planning becomes a standard scientific practice early in the research process when data is generated or collected, including through the requirement of data management plans,
    - research data that results from publicly funded research becomes and stays findable, accessible, interoperable and re-usable (‘FAIR principles’) within a secure and trusted environment, through digital infrastructures (including those federated within the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC), where relevant), unless this is not possible or is incompatible with the further exploitation of the research results (‘as open as possible, as closed as necessary’). This could be for reasons, in particular, of privacy, trade secrets, national security, legitimate commercial interests and to intellectual property rights of third parties. Any data, know-how and/or information whatever its form or nature which is held by private parties in a joint public/private partnership prior to the research action should not be affected by these policies or national action plans,
    - taking into account technological developments (including of dynamic (real-time) data), licensing terms used on the market do not unduly restrict text and data mining of research data resulting from publicly funded research, in accordance with and without prejudice to the applicable copyright legislation,
    - innovative companies, in particular small and medium-sized enterprises, independent researchers (for instance citizen scientists), the public sector, the press and citizens at large have, in a transparent and non-discriminatory manner, the widest possible access to the research data of the results of research that receives public funding in view of enabling innovation, empowering the public sector and informing citizens.

4. Member States should ensure that research funding institutions responsible for managing public research funding and academic institutions receiving public funding implement the policies and national action plans referred to in point 3 at national level in a coordinated way by:
    - setting institutional policies for research data management, and establishing implementation plans,
    - including requirements for data management plans and open access to research data as a principle (‘as open as possible, as closed as necessary’) for projects producing research data in grant agreements and other financial support for research, together with mechanisms for monitoring compliance with those requirements and follow up actions to correct cases of non-compliance,
    - making the necessary funding for data management available,
    - providing guidance to researchers on how to comply with research data management policies, and supporting them to do so, especially regarding the development of sound data management planning skills and digital infrastructures that support access to and preservation of research data,
    - ensuring that datasets are easily identifiable through persistent identifiers and can be linked to other datasets and publications through appropriate mechanisms, and that additional information is provided to enable their proper evaluation and use.

## Preservation and re-use of scientific information

5. Member States should ensure that, as a result of those policies or action plans:
    - academic institutions receiving public funding develop policies on the preservation of their scientific output,
    - an effective system of deposit for electronic scientific information is in place, covering born-digital publications and the related research output,
    - scientific information selected for long-term preservation receives appropriate curation, along with hardware and software necessary to allow the re-use of the information,
    - unique identification (interlinking of research outputs, researchers, their affiliations and funders, and contributors) is promoted through a wide range of persistent identifiers, in order to enable findability, reproducibility and long-term preservation of the research results,
    - machine-readable licensing systems and conditions are in place, compatible with already existing open licences, which allow the re-use of scientific information resulting from publicly-funded research in accordance with and without prejudice to applicable copyright legislation, in order to enable legal re-use and preservation,
    - the conditions for stakeholders to offer value-added services based on the re-use of scientific information are fostered.

## Infrastructures for open science

6. Member States should ensure that, as a result of these policies or national action plans:
    - resources are earmarked, leveraged and built to be economically efficient and to innovate while fostering competition within the internal market,
    - the quality and reliability of the infrastructure are ensured, including through the use of widely recognised certification mechanisms, specifications and standards,
    - researchers have an increased access, in a transparent and non-discriminatory manner, to research resources and services for storing, managing, analysing, sharing, and re-using scientific information, including through the EOSC, when available,
    - through the use of additional indicators and metrics, infrastructures are fit to collect information that underpins the monitoring and assessment of openness and open science as well as of research and career evaluation.

7. Member States should ensure synergies among national infrastructures, with the EOSC and other global initiatives by:
    - engaging into the definition of standards for data and services to be accessed through the EOSC, as well as indicators and metrics to measure research impact in the context of the EOSC,
    - guaranteeing the interoperability of newly developed or upgraded infrastructures so that they take account of the development of the EOSC and, thus, prevent the emergence of silos, contributing to the reduction of fragmentation and promotion of scientific discovery and collaboration across disciplines and countries,
    - preparing the ground for the use of services and the sharing of scientific information through the EOSC.

## Skills and competences

8. Member States should ensure that, as a result of those policies or action plans:
    - the necessary training and education are provided about open access, data research management, data stewardship, data preservation, data curation and open science, as part of the higher education and training system, at all career stages, and they reach on-the-job best practice in the industry,
    - the promotion or implementation, or both, of advanced-degree programmes of new professional profiles in the area of data handling technologies are provided,
    - the development and training of data-intensive computational science experts are supported, including for data specialists, technicians and data managers.

## Incentives and rewards

9. Member States should ensure that, as a result of those policies or action plans:
    - the academic career system supports and rewards researchers who participate in a culture of sharing the results of their research, in particular by ensuring early sharing and open access to their publications and other research outputs,
    - institutions responsible for managing public research funding and academic institutions that are publicly funded assist in implementing national policy by putting in place mechanisms enabling, measuring and rewarding the sharing of scientific information,
    - research and career evaluation systems are enriched through the introduction of additional indicators and metrics that can inform assessment on openness, including but not only on the broader social impact of research and at the individual level of a researcher (‘new generation metrics’).
    - Multi-stakeholder dialogue on open science at national, European and international level

10. Member States should participate in multi-stakeholder dialogues on the transition towards open science at national, European and international level on each of the issues addressed in points 1 to 9.Member States should ensure that:
    - those dialogues strengthen a linked open science technological environment that covers all research outputs from all phases of the research life cycle (data, publications, software, methods, protocols, etc.),
    - a systemic change towards open science is gradually achieved and includes, beyond the technological change and efficiency, the principle of reciprocity, cultural change among researchers, as well as institutional change in research within academic institutions and funders towards open science, including where applicable issues such as research integrity and ethics.

## Structured coordination of Member States at Union level and follow-up to this Recommendation

11. Member States should have a national point of reference the tasks of which would be:
    - coordinating the measures listed in this Recommendation,
    - acting as an interlocutor with the Commission on questions pertaining to access to and preservation of scientific information, in particular better definitions of common principles and standards, implementation measures and new ways of disseminating and sharing research results in the European Research Area,
    - reporting on the follow-up to this Recommendation.

12. Member States should inform the Commission 18 months from the publication of this Recommendation in the Official Journal of the European Union, and every two years thereafter, of action taken in response to the elements of this Recommendation. On that basis, the Commission should review the progress made across the Union to assess whether further action is needed to achieve the objectives proposed in this Recommendation.
