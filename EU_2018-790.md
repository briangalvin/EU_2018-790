# National Policy Statement on access to and preservation of publicly-funded research, and the transition to Open Scholarship. (Open Research?)

This policy covers the following interrelated aspects of Open Research (including access to and preservation of research):
  - the dissemination of and open access to publications resulting from publicly funded research;
  - the management of research data resulting from publicly funded research, including open access;
  - reinforcing the preservation and re-use of research information (publications, data sets and other research outputs);
  - developing infrastructures underpinning the system for access to, preservation, sharing and re-use of research outputs and for promoting their federation within the EOSC;
  - the necessary skills and competences of researchers and personnel of academic institutions regarding research information;
  - for adjusting, with regards to research information, the recruitment and career evaluation system for researchers, the evaluation system for awarding research grants to researchers, and the evaluation systems for research performing institutions; 
  
## Common Principles

The following common principles are adopted to provide an overarching framework for national policy and for individual research organisations’ policies on open access to publications and research data management including open access. 
	
1.	This policy is intended to increase the visibility of, and improve access to, the outputs of research funded by the Irish State.

2.	This policy is designed to support the free flow of information across national and international research communities; to support the principle of research-enabled teaching and learning and the generation of Open Educational Resources (OER); to contribute to Open Innovation through richer and more effective knowledge transfer and diffusion; and to support greater transparency, accountability and public awareness of the results of publicly funded research.

3.	This policy aims to support individual researchers by maximising the impact of their work while ensuring that they are recognised, rewarded and supported in their practice of open research.   
i) The freedom of researchers to publish wherever they feel is the most appropriate is reaffirmed.   
ii) Researchers who have reason to deposit publications or data into more than one repository shall be required to deposit once only.   
iii) Every publicly funded researcher in Ireland shall have deposit rights in a suitable repository.

4.	This policy calls upon research performing institutions and funders to align their policies on research publications, research data management, rewards and recognition and associated implementation plans with this national policy. In particular:   
i) Research funders should include in grant agreements and other financial support for research, their requirements for data management plans, open access to research data as a principle for projects producing research data, together with mechanisms for monitoring compliance with those requirements and follow up actions to correct cases of non-compliance.   
ii) Research funders should make available the necessary funding to support research data management.

5.	This policy confirms the following principles in relation to research data management:   
i) FAIR data contribute to research integrity and reproducibility.   
ii) Research data should be as open as possible, as restricted as necessary.   
iii) Creating findable, accessible and interoperable research data depends on the capacity and skills of all those involved at each stage of the research process.   
iv) Prior planning is essential to ensure research data are managed effectively through all stages of the research cycle, from creation to long-term preservation.   
v) Research data should be interoperable across disciplinary boundaries to enable unrestricted sharing of reusable data between different systems and domains.   
vi) A robust citation mechanism for referencing data are necessary for research validation and to make data findable and accessible.

6. The implementation of this policy will be detailed in successive national action plans which will  provide for coordinating mechanisms and monitoring processes and for supporting infrastructures including preservation, for open access to publicly funded publications and for the management of research data resulting from publicly funded research, including open access. The action plans for each of these areas will consist of:   
i) concrete objectives and indicators to measure progress,   
ii) implementation plans, including the allocation of responsibilities and appropriate licensing,   
iii) associated financial planning.

## Open access to research publications

Ireland’s goal is to ensure that all Irish publicly funded peer reviewed research articles published from 2020 onwards will be openly available by default, to be accessible in a timely manner and on an ongoing basis. In order to achieve this goal, the following principles are adopted:

7. Peer reviewed journal articles and conference papers along with other research outputs resulting in whole or in part from publicly funded research should be deposited in a suitable repository which will enable them, alongside their metadata, to be made publicly findable, accessible, interoperable and re-usable as soon as possible and on an on-going basis.

8. A repository is suitable for the purpose of this policy when it is structured to ensure that its contents are openly findable, accessible, interoperable and re-usable. This ensures that the repository provides free public access to its contents, supports interoperability with other repositories and with other research information and reporting systems, provides clear re-use guidelines including on text- and data-mining, is harvestable by national portal/s and international aggregators and takes steps toward long-term preservation. (A list of suitable repositories is included in Appredix X).

9. The version of a paper to made available on open access is the author's final peer-reviewed manuscript (or the publisher's final version if permitted), which should be deposited in a suitable repository regardless of the paper's publishing model (e.g. Gold, Hybrid, Other). 

10. Other research outputs including books, book chapters and reports should be deposited where possible. 

11. Deposit of publications should be made as soon as possible, ideally at the time of acceptance for publication, and no later than the date of formal publication.

12. Metadata should be deposited alongside the paper and should comprise the full bibliographic and/or descriptive data along with funder names and grant numbers, where applicable, ensuring that publications resulting from public funding are easily identifiable. Metadata should comply with national and international standards, and utilise identifiers and agreements for harvesting, reporting and interoperability.

13. Repositories shall release the metadata immediately upon deposit. Open access to the full text paper should be made immediately upon deposit or upon the publication date at the latest, except for articles with a publisher-required embargo period. An embargo may be applied as long as it does not exceed six months for scientific, technical and health science research publications and twelve months for arts, humanities and social sciences research outputs.

14. Open access content made available under the terms of this policy must be accompanied by an appropriate licence such as CC-BY or equivalent. Licencing terms should not unduly restrict text and data mining, in accordance with and without prejudice to applicable copyright legislation.

15. Payment of additional open access charges through the ‘Gold’ open access model is not necessary to comply with this policy.   
i) Researchers and their research funding agencies or librarians through ‘off-setting’ arrangements may choose to pay publishers open access charges, however this practice will not replace the requirement for deposit in a suitable repository.   
ii) Research papers published in open access journals must be deposited in a suitable repository in the same way as other publications.   
iii) Publicly funded open publishing platforms will be asked to agree mechanisms to support the terms of this policy. Mechanisms shall be sought with other publishers to facilitate the deposit of eligible publications into suitable repositories in support of this policy.

16. All those involved in the Irish research system, including publishers, editors, referees, librarians, funders and researchers will be made aware of standards of professional conduct on licensing, editorial process, soliciting submissions, disclosing ownership, the handling of publication fees and the benefits of open access publishing along with general principles of quality and value for public funding (including the need to negotiate the best possible terms for access and re-use). Publishers’ copyright and licensing policies must be respected.

17. In the interest of public transparency and fair competition and without prejudice to the protection of know-how and business information (trade secrets), information will be published about agreements between public institutions or groups of public institutions and publishers on the supply of scientific and research information, including information on ‘big deal’ arrangements, ‘off-setting’ agreements and the details of author processing charge (APC) payments.

18. Initiatives will be explored to enhance open access research papers with formats, supplementary content and technologies to assist people with disabilities and to generally increase the public accessibility of the content.

19. Research data should be linked to publications and made as open as possible, as restricted as necessary, in accordance with the national research data management principles, as outlined below.

## Management of research data, including open access


20. Data management planning is required as a standard practice from the earliest stage in the research process when data are generated or collected. Data management plans will be required as part of that standard practice and will outline how the research data are to be curated throughout the research cycle, which data may need to be kept private, which data shall be selected for sharing and long-term preservation and what resourcing, if any, is necessary to ensure that research data are findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable. 

21. Datasets arising from public funding should be made easily identifiable through persistent identifiers and should be accompanied by standardised metadata, including funder names and grant numbers.   
i) Where appropriate, datasets should be linked to other datasets and publications through recognised mechanisms.   
ii) Additional information should be provided to enable the proper evaluation and use of such datasets.   
iii) Through the employment of interoperability standards, researchers should facilitate re-use by colleagues in the same field, by colleagues in other disciplines and, at the broadest extent possible, automated processes which seek to discover and act across large, heterogeneous datasets.

22. Research data resulting from publicly funded research shall be as open as possible, as restricted as necessary.   
i) Research data resulting from publicly funded research shall be as open as possible i.e. they will become and remain findable, accessible, interoperable and re-usable (‘FAIR principles’) within a secure and trusted environment, through national and international digital infrastructures, including those federated within the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC), where relevant.   
ii) Research data arising from public funding shall be as restricted as necessary. Where openness is not possible for justifiable reasons, such as commercial exploitation,  confidentiality, security, protection of personal data, the achievement of the project’s aim, incompatibility with the further exploitation of the research results or other stated legitimate grounds.   
iii) Taking into account technological developments (including of dynamic (real-time) data), licensing terms used on the market should not unduly restrict text and data mining of research data resulting from publicly funded research, in accordance with and without prejudice to the applicable copyright legislation.   
iv) Any data, know-how and/or information whatever its form or nature which is held by private parties in a joint public/private partnership prior to the research action shall not be affected by this policy.


## Preservation and Infrastructure

23. Infrastructures underpinning access to, preservation, sharing and re-use of scientific information and for promoting their federation within the EOSC will be developed and aligned with national policies such as Innovation2020 Action 4.7 and related/subsequent policies.

24. Opportunities for time and cost savings and other efficiencies associated with streamlining and removal of duplication from research reporting processes will be pursued through a joined-up national research information infrastructure, standardized data practices and optimal administrative coordination. Resources will be earmarked, leveraged and built to be economically efficient and to innovate while fostering competition within the internal market.

25. The quality and reliability of the infrastructure will be ensured, including through the use of internationally recognised certification mechanisms, specifications and standards.

26. Researchers will have an increased access, in a transparent and non-discriminatory manner, to research resources and services for storing, managing, analysing, sharing, and re-using scientific information (including through the EOSC, when available).

27. Through the use of additional indicators and metrics, infrastructures will be developed and made fit to collect information that underpins the monitoring and assessment of openness and open science as well as of research and career evaluation.

28. Synergies will be ensured among national infrastructures as well as with the EOSC and other global initiatives by:   
i) Engaging in the definition of standards for data and services to be accessed through the EOSC, as well as indicators and metrics to measure research impact in the context of the EOSC;   
ii) Guaranteeing the interoperability of newly developed or upgraded infrastructures so that they take account of the development of the EOSC and, thus, prevent the emergence of silos, contributing to the reduction of fragmentation and promotion of scientific discovery and collaboration across disciplines and countries;   
iii) Preparing for the use of services and sharing of scientific information through the EOSC.

## Skills and competences

29. These principles will be incorporated into best practice, standardised and accredited Open Science / Open Scholarship skills provision for researchers at all researcher career levels including research students and supervisors. Researchers shall be equipped with the broad range of necessary competences in this area, including the facility, when entering into contractual agreements with scientific publishers, to discern the necessary intellectual property rights required for self-archiving and to support re-use through text and data mining. 

30. Library professionals, data stewards and ICT personnel who provide support, training, advocacy and policy and infrastructural development for open access publications and/or research data management will be recognised in this role and included in the national and institutional implementation plans and associated financial planning.   
i) Advanced-degree programmes in the area of data handling technologies will be provided in support of new professional profiles;   
ii) The development and training of data-intensive computational science experts will be supported, including for data specialists, technicians and data managers.   
iii) Specialist open research skills for library professionals will be included in library and information science curricula and continuing professional development.

## Incentives and rewards

31. Information on open access to publicly funded publications and research data along with skills attainment as outlined by this policy will be included in institutional research reporting and evaluation at the national level.

32. Research performing institutions should ensure that the academic career system supports and rewards researchers who participate in a culture of sharing the results of their research, in particular by enabling early sharing and open access to their publications and other research outputs,
    
33. Research funding institutions and research performing institutions should adopt Open Science / Open Scholarship metrics to enrich research and career evaluation systems and for reporting, recruitment, career progression/promotion and evaluation purposes. Indicators and metrics that can inform assessment on openness should be applied, including those at the individual researcher level and those on the broader social impact of research (‘next generation metrics’).

34. Research funding institutions should include requirements for open access as a condition for awarding grant agreements or to provide other financial support for research, together with mechanisms for monitoring compliance with these requirements and follow-up actions to correct cases of non-compliance.

## Multi-stakeholder dialogue on open science at national, European and international level

35. Through this policy and related action plans, Ireland will continue its leading role in this area and will participate in multi-stakeholder dialogues on the transition towards open science/open research at national, European and international level in order to:   
i) strengthen a linked open science technological environment that covers all research outputs from all phases of the research life cycle (data, publications, software, methods, protocols, etc.),   
ii) work towards the gradual achievement of systemic change towards open research including, beyond technological change and efficiency, the principle of reciprocity, cultural change amongst researchers and within academic institutions and funding agencies, and issues such as research integrity and ethics.

36. The availability and extent of open access publicly-funded publications and research data will be actively and strategically promoted in order to ensure that innovative companies, in particular small and medium-sized enterprises, independent researchers such as citizen scientists, the public sector, schools, public libraries, the press and citizens at large have, in a transparent and non-discriminatory manner, the widest possible access to research publications and the results of research that receives public funding. 						

37. The use and re-use of publicly funded open access publications and research data will be actively practiced and demonstrated by government and public sector bodies as well by as research performing organisations.

38. Researchers should cite publicly funded research data wherever appropriate and applicable, ensuring that the data citation adheres to common, international and readily available referencing standards.

39. In the interest of public transparency, evidence-based public policy documents should clearly reference and cite open access publicly funded publications and research data wherever possible and appropriate, ensuring that the publication and data citation practice adheres to common, international and readily available referencing standards. 

40. Through this poilcy and in line with the recommendation (2018/790/EU), a national point of reference will be established to undertake the following tasks:   
i) coordinate the measures listed in European Commission Recommendation (2018/790/EU) of 25 April 2018 on access to and preservation of scientific information   
ii) act as an interlocutor with the European Commission on questions pertaining to access to and preservation of scientific information, in particular better definitions of common principles and standards, implementation measures and new ways of disseminating and sharing research results in the European Research Area,   
iii) report on the follow-up to the European Commission Recommendation (2018/790/EU) of 25 April 2018 on access to and preservation of publicly-funded research.
